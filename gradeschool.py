Introduction
Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.

In the end, you should be able to:

Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
"Add Jim to grade 2."
"OK."
Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
"Which students are in grade 2?"
"We've only got Jim just now."
Get a sorted list of all students in all grades. Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.
"Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
"Grade 1: Anna, Barb, and Charlie. Grade 2: Alex, Peter, and Zoe. Grade 3â€¦"
Note that all our students only have one name. (It's a small town, what do you want?)
